			<h1>Markup in HTML</h1>
			<p>HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes), character-based data types, character references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like ands, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example <img>. The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).Another important component is the HTML document type declaration, which triggers standards mode rendering.</p>

		<p>The text between html and /html describes the web page, and the text between body and /body is the visible page content. The markup text title and /title defines the browser page title shown on browser tabs and window titles, and the tag div defines a division of the page used for easy styling. Between head and /head, a meta element can be used to define webpage metadata.The Document Type Declaration <!DOCTYPE html> is for HTML5. If a declaration is not included, various browsers will revert to "quirks mode" for rendering.</p>
